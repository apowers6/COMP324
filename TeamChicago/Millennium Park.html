          Millennium Park is a public park located in the Loop community area of
          Chicago in Illinois, US, and originally intended to celebrate the second
          millennium. It is a prominent civic center near the city's Lake Michigan
          shoreline that covers a 24.5-acre (99,000 m2) section of northwestern
          Grant Park. The area was previously occupied by parkland, Illinois Central
          rail yards, and parking lots.The park, which is bounded by Michigan
          Avenue, Randolph Street, Columbus Drive and East Monroe Drive, features
          a variety of public art. As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only Navy Pier
          as a Chicago tourist attraction.In 2015, the park became the location
          of the city's annual Christmas tree lighting.
