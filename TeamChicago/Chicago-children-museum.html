           The Chicago Children's Museum is located at Navy Pier in Chicago,
            Illinois. It was founded in 1982 by The Junior League of Chicago who
            were responding to programming cutbacks in the Chicago Public Schools.
            Originally housed in two hallways of the Chicago Public Library, it
            soon began to offer trunk shows and traveling exhibits in response to
            capacity crowds on-site.
