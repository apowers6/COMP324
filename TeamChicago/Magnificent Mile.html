          <p> The Magnificent Mile, sometimes referred to as The Mag Mile, is
            an upscale section of Chicago's Michigan Avenue, running from the
            Chicago River to Oak Street in the Near North Side.[1] The district
            is located adjacent to downtown, and one block east of Rush Street.
            The Magnificent Mile serves as the main thoroughfare between Chicago's
            Loop business district and its Gold Coast.[2] It is generally the western
            boundary of the Streeterville neighborhood, to its east and River North
            to the west.
